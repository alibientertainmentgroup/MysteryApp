THEME: Test Theme

[THEME NOTES]
This theme is a test theme. The notes for this theme will go here—such as placing out a clue before the game starts or anything else that’s required by the game.

[PRE-INTRODUCTION HOST INSTRUCTIONS]
Before the game begins, pull all the characters together and show them a Round 1 card as an example. Explain how the game will flow and let them know they’ll each have similar cards with information to share. Instruct them to mingle with the guests and share their information gradually—don’t give all the details to one person. Instead, mix it up and distribute the information across multiple conversations to keep the game engaging for everyone.

[GAMEINTRODUCTION HOST SCRIPT]
Good evening all you wonderful, exciting and … devious people and welcome to A Murder Mystery Dinner’s – THEME NAME GOES HERE. Tonight, we play a game. A game of mystery, deceit, and murder. Tonight, one of you is going to die by the hands of another in this room. Who will the murderer be? This is what we must find out.

You will work in teams – who is on your team is your choice. Those of you with name tags are our characters. The rest of you are attendees soon to become investigators.

This game has 4 Rounds each lasting around 20 minutes. In round one you will learn all about our characters. Who they are, what they do, and who they are involved with? In round 2 we will begin to uncover their motives. In Round 3, someone will die, and your investigation will begin. Then finally in round 4, we will accuse our murderer of their crime.

[ROUND 1 HOST INSTRUCTIONS]
Collect the Character Bio cards and pass out the Round 1 cards after announcing the start of Round 1. The host should stay in character and mingle with the guests. This round may start a little slowly—people might be unsure of what to do. Encourage all characters to read their cards first, then interact based on what’s written.
Five minutes before the end of the round, when the timer goes off, give a 5-minute warning to the room.

[ROUND 1 HOST SCRIPT]
“Ladies and gentlemen, Round One has officially begun! Characters, I’m handing out your Round One cards now. Please read your card and then begin mingling with other characters and guests, sharing the clues you've learned. Just a reminder—your host is not part of the crime!”

[ROUND 2 HOST INSTRUCTIONS]
Announce the beginning of Round 2, then pass out the Round 2 cards. Characters may keep their Round 1 cards to refer back to. This round usually flows more naturally as everyone starts getting into the game. Encourage characters to read their new cards and mingle based on their updated objectives.
When there are 5 minutes remaining, announce the warning.

Also, after the 5-minute warning, discreetly inform the designated victim that it’s their time to “die,” and begin setting up the scene as described in the theme file. Make sure to create a dramatic and attention-grabbing moment!

[ROUND 2 HOST SCRIPT]
“Round Two is underway! Characters, here are your Round Two cards. Take a moment to read them, then continue mingling and sharing information. And remember—your host is not part of the crime!”

[MEAL BREAK INSTRUCTIONS]
If a meal break is being used, this is the perfect time to pause the game for about 30 minutes so guests can eat. Let them know they are free to continue casual conversations, but game-related interaction is paused. This is a good time for the host to reset props, check in with characters, and prep for Round 3. Once the break is over, call everyone back together and begin the next round.

[ROUND 3 HOST INSTRUCTIONS]
After the meal break (if there is one), announce the start of Round 3. At this point, the crime will occur, and the investigation will begin. Encourage characters to react to the murder—shock, suspicion, fear—and start theorizing and sharing new clues.
The host should hand out Round 3 cards and stay active in character, helping stir the pot. With 5 minutes left, give the final warning.

[ROUND 3 HOST SCRIPT]
“Welcome back, everyone. Round Three is now in play! Characters, take your Round Three cards and prepare yourselves—something terrible is about to happen. Read your card, mingle, and begin piecing together this mystery. Time is ticking!”

[ROUND 4 HOST INSTRUCTIONS]
Once Round 3 concludes, gather everyone for Round 4. Distribute the final cards. This is where teams make their final accusations and try to solve the mystery. Remind them to agree on one killer per team.
Allow time for each team to present their accusation, then let characters read their final statements in order. The killer will be the last to reveal their truth. Be sure to celebrate everyone’s effort and encourage applause and photos.

[ROUND 4 HOST SCRIPT]
“It’s time for the final round! This is where everything comes together. Characters, take your Round Four cards. Teams, now’s your chance to make your accusations. Work together, decide on your suspect, and prepare to share your theory with the group.
Once all teams have spoken, our characters will reveal their final statements—and the killer will come clean!”
