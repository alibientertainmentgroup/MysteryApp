[PRE-INTRODUCTION HOST INSTRUCTIONS]
Before the game begins, pull all the characters together and show them a Round 1 card as an example. Explain how the game will flow and let them know they’ll each have similar cards with information to share. Instruct them to mingle with the guests and share their information gradually—don’t give all the details to one person. Instead, mix it up and distribute the information across multiple conversations to keep the game engaging for everyone.
